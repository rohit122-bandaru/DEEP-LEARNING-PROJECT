# DESCRIPTION

In Task 2 of our internship, we developed an image classification deep learning model using TensorFlow and Keras in Google Colab. We used the Fashion MNIST dataset, which includes grayscale images of clothing items classified into 10 categories. The model was built using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) consisting of two convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, a dense hidden layer, and a softmax output layer. We trained the model for 10 epochs and achieved a test accuracy of approximately 89%. The training and validation accuracy were visualized using a matplotlib graph. This task demonstrates the practical implementation of deep learning for image classification.
